I used SDLC throughout the project which enabled the users to maintain the daily stock of the pharmacy. The purpose was to simply allow the verified users to allow them to store the medicines in the stock with particular shelves number and to monitor sales numbers, track revenue daily basis, or in between two dates. Also, there are some additional functionalities that made my project more user-friendly such as auto recommendation system, PDF saving system etc.
There are some more about the Pharmacy Management System:
•	I developed this project at my undergraduate and this is a desktop base application 
•	I used Software Life Cycle throughout the project 
•	I used Java as a primary language and MySQL database
