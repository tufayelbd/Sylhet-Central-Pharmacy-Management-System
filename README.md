Pharmacy Management System Key Functionalities:
•	I developed this project at my undergraduate and this is a desktop base application 
•	I used Software Life Cycle throughout the project 
•	I used Java as a primary language and MySQL database
•	This project was able to maintain the daily stock of the pharmacy.
•	Basically, verified users can store the medicine in the stock with particular shelves number and can sell the medicine. Moreover, users can check daily sell, and profit and make the voucher daily basis or in between two dates.
•	Also, there was some additional functionalities that made my project more user friendly.
